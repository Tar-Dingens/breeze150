# breeze150

This project is an upscaled version of the Breeze style created to match a scale factor of 1.5. It increases the size of scrollbars, buttons, and similar UI elements. It does not change the size of fonts or icons. Custom UI elements of applications are affected neither.  

To use this style the `font` dpi should be set to *144* which equals a scale factor of 1.5 or a roughly similar value. Furthermore increasing the icon size to match the scale factor is highly recommended. 

To get the best experience set:
 * `Main Toolbar` to *32*
 * `Toolbar` to *32*
 * `Small Icons` to *24*
 * `Dialogs` to *48*

The icon size *24* is, while supported by the breeze icon theme, not available in the System Settings icon size selection so you have to set it manually in `~/.config/kdeglobals`.
